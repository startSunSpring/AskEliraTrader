## 🛡️ Vex Implementation Deep Dive

### **Core Capabilities**

#### 1. **8-Point Adversarial Audit Checklist**

```python
from Agents.vex import audit_simulation

verdict = audit_simulation(
    market=market,
    sim_result=sim_result,
    seed_path=seed_path,
    sim_prompt=sim_prompt
)

# Returns VexVerdict:
# VexVerdict(
#     verdict="PASS" | "PASS-WITH-WARNINGS" | "FAIL",
#     findings=["[1] PASS — ...", "[2] WARN — ...", ...],
#     confidence="HIGH" | "MEDIUM" | "LOW" | "DO NOT DEPLOY",
#     override_risk=True|False
# )
```

**Checklist Items:**

1. **Resolution Criteria Match** (NLP semantic similarity via Claude)
   - Detects drift between simulation goal and contract language
   - Threshold: 85% similarity required
   - Failure = FAIL verdict

2. **Seed Quality** (recency + diversity)
   - Sources must be <72h for fast-moving markets (≤7 days to resolution)
   - No single source >50% of seed content
   - Violations = WARN

3. **Agent Population Bias** (domain mismatch detection)
   - Cross-checks David's domain classification
   - Flags obvious mismatches (e.g., "election" classified as "financial")
   - Violations = WARN

4. **Run Stability** (variance double-check)
   - Enforces <15% variance threshold (should already be checked by David)
   - Violations = FAIL

5. **Confidence Inflation** (>85% scrutiny)
   - Flags confidence >85% for extra review
   - Polymarket rarely misprices this much unless near resolution
   - Violations = WARN

6. **Single-Point-of-Failure** (Claude-powered risk assessment)
   - Detects markets dependent on one person's decision/tweet
   - Examples: "Will Elon tweet X?" = HIGH RISK
   - Violations = WARN + override_risk flag to Orb

7. **Look-Ahead Contamination** (source date scanning)
   - Checks if any source is dated AFTER market resolution
   - Contaminated seeds contain outcome information
   - Violations = FAIL

8. **Calibration Check** (historical accuracy gating)
   - Requires ≥60% accuracy on similar market categories
   - If below threshold, flags for manual Orb review
   - Violations = WARN

#### 2. **Verdict Logic**

```python
# FAIL verdict → DO NOT DEPLOY
if any critical check fails:
    verdict = "FAIL"
    confidence = "DO NOT DEPLOY"

# PASS-WITH-WARNINGS → tiered confidence
elif any warnings:
    verdict = "PASS-WITH-WARNINGS"
    if critical_warnings >= 2 or override_risk:
        confidence = "LOW"
    else:
        confidence = "MEDIUM"

# PASS → HIGH confidence
else:
    verdict = "PASS"
    confidence = "HIGH"
```

#### 3. **NLP-Powered Checks**

**Resolution Criteria Match:**
```python
# Uses Claude to detect semantic drift
SYSTEM_CRITERIA_MATCH = """
Even small differences in wording can change the meaning 
of a binary prediction. Detect drift between:
- Market resolution criteria (exact contract language)
- Simulation prompt (what MiroFish predicted)
"""
# Returns: match (bool), semantic_similarity (0.0-1.0), drift_explanation
```

**Single-Point-of-Failure:**
```python
SYSTEM_SINGLE_POINT = """
Detect if resolution depends on a single unpredictable actor:
- One person's whim (e.g., "Will Elon tweet X?")
- One institution's decision (e.g., Supreme Court ruling)
- One event outside simulation scope
"""
# Returns: single_point_risk (bool), risk_description, override_probability
```

#### 4. **Integration with David**

- Imports `get_category_accuracy()` from David for calibration check
- Imports `_classify_domain()` from David for population bias check
- Validates David's SimResult (variance, confidence, direction)

## 📊 David Implementation Deep Dive

### **Core Capabilities**

#### 1. **Multi-Run Orchestration**
```python
run_simulation(
    market=market,
    seed_path=seed_path,
    sim_prompt=sim_prompt,
    min_runs=3,
    variance_threshold=0.15
)
```
- Runs MiroFish `min_runs` times (default 3)
- Self-blocks if fewer than `min_runs` succeed
- Self-blocks if variance exceeds `variance_threshold` (default 15%)
- Returns averaged `SimResult` with consensus direction

#### 2. **Domain Classification**
Automatically classifies markets into:
- **Political:** Elections, regulations, congressional votes
- **Financial:** Fed decisions, stock movements, economic data
- **Geopolitical:** Wars, treaties, sanctions, diplomacy
- **Corporate:** Mergers, CEO changes, earnings
- **Default:** General fallback

Each domain has custom agent population configs:
```python
AGENT_POPULATIONS = {
    "political": {
        "retail_public": 0.35,
        "political_analysts": 0.25,
        "media": 0.20,
        "institutional": 0.15,
        "activists": 0.05,
    },
    # ... (financial, geopolitical, corporate, default)
}
```

#### 3. **Variance Checking**
- Calculates standard deviation across all run confidences
- **Gate:** If variance >15%, simulation is "unstable" → self-block
- Example: Runs at [72%, 68%, 91%] → variance = 11.9% → **PASS**
- Example: Runs at [55%, 88%, 72%] → variance = 16.6% → **FAIL (self-block)**

#### 4. **Confidence Extraction**
Multi-pattern regex matching:
```python
- "YES: 73%"
- "NO wins at 62%"
- "probability of YES is 71%"
- "confidence: 0.73"
- Fallback to mirofish_client._extract_sim_result()
```

#### 5. **Calibration Log**
CSV format:
```
DATE | MARKET | PLATFORM | SIM_CONFIDENCE | SIM_DIRECTION | ACTUAL_OUTCOME | 
WIN_LOSS | VARIANCE | TIER | POSITION_SIZE | PNL | SEED_QUALITY | LESSON
```

Lessons generated via Claude `claude-sonnet-4-5`:
```
"Seed quality was high; FOMC minutes were decisive signal."
"Alba should add more institutional sources for macro markets."
"Agent mix needs more crypto-native retail for Web3 predictions."
```

#### 6. **Self-Check Protocol**
Before handing to Vex:
- ✅ Variance ≤15%
- ✅ Confidence ≥50% (edge exists)
- ✅ Direction consistency across runs
- ⚠️  Warns if confidence >95% (may need extra Vex scrutiny)

## 🔬 MiroFish Integration Details

### **Full Pipeline (A → B → C)**

**Step A: Upload Seed + Build Graph**
```python
graph_id, project_id = client.upload_seed_and_build_graph(
    seed_txt_path=Path("data/seeds/2026-03-14-fed-decision.txt"),
    simulation_requirement="Predict YES/NO for Fed rate cut",
    project_name="fed-rate-2026-03-run1"
)
```
- Uploads Alba's seed file
- Generates ontology (entity/relationship extraction)
- Builds knowledge graph in Zep memory

**Step B: Run OASIS Simulation**
```python
simulation_id = client.run_simulation(graph_id, project_id)
```
- Creates simulation record
- Prepares simulation (LLM generates agent profiles)
- Starts simulation runner (30 rounds max)
- Polls until complete (timeout: 40 min)

**Step C: Generate Report**
```python
report_id, markdown = client.generate_and_fetch_report(simulation_id)
```
- Triggers MiroFish `ReportAgent`
- Polls until report ready (timeout: 30 min)
- Returns full markdown report text

**Total Time per Run:** ~15-45 minutes (depending on seed size)

## 🧪 Testing David

### **Mock Mode (Recommended for Development)**
```python
# In mirofish_client.py, add a MockMiroFishClient class
# Returns fake simulation results without hitting real backend
```

### **Real MiroFish Test**
```bash
# 1. Ensure MiroFish Docker is running
docker ps | grep mirofish

# 2. Run David with a test seed file
python -c "
from Agents.alba import build_seed_file
from Agents.david import run_simulation
from models import Market
from pathlib import Path

market = Market(
    question='Will the Fed cut rates in March 2026?',
    platform='Polymarket',
    yes_price=0.42,
    resolution_date='2026-03-31',
    resolution_criteria='Fed cuts by ≥25 bps at March FOMC',
    liquidity=50000,
    why_mispriced='News suggests dovish pivot',
    uncertainty='MEDIUM'
)

# Use existing seed file or create new one
seed_path = Path('data/seeds/2026-03-14-fed-decision-in-march.txt')

sim_result = run_simulation(
    market=market,
    seed_path=seed_path,
    sim_prompt='Will the Federal Reserve decrease interest rates by 25 basis points after the March 2026 FOMC meeting?'
)

print(f'Result: {sim_result.direction} @ {sim_result.confidence:.0%}')
print(f'Variance: {sim_result.variance:.2%}')
"
```
